Data wrangling for fun and profit
=================================

Welcome to **DataPatterns.org**, a collection of tips and tricks for data 
work. This collection is not an finished document but a collection of 
opinions and evolving best practices. The purpose is not to present all 
available options and technologies but to pick one and follow it through.
DataPatterns is also a collaborative effort: if you have some good hacks and 
would like to share them, please contribute a patch to the `DataPatterns 
repository`_
