Data wrangling for fun and profit
=================================

Welcome to the **Data Wrangling Handbook**.

This handbook is not a finished document but a collection of opinions and
evolving best practices. The purpose is not to present all available options
and technologies but to pick one and follow it through.

The Handbook is also a collaborative effort: if you have a recipe, a tool or a
howto and would like to share them, please contribute a patch to the `Data
Wrangling Handbook git repository`_
