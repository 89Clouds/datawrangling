Scraping web sites
==================

Screen-scraping web sites is the process of extracting structured information
from ordinary web sites or on-line databases using custom scripts or scripted 
procedures. Scraping can be used to extract large archives of online content 
into a form more suitable for further processing. This is particularly 
fruitful when the web site you are scraping is based on a structured database
and all you have to do is to reverse the rendering of content.

In general, the following problems are common when scraping data:

 * Badly formatted HTML code with little or no structural information.
 * Authentication systems that are supposed to prevent automatic access.
 * Session-based systems that use browser cookies to maintain state.
 * Lack of complete listings and possibilities for wildcard search.
 * Blocking of bulk access.
 * Use of outdated server technologies and inappropriate data formats.
