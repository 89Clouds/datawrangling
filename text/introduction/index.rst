Data is all around us and we create more and more of it every day. In our
networked age information is a valuable asset. Data is the resource where
we gain information and finally knowledge from. The Open Knowledge
Foundation promotes open knowledge because of its potential to deliver
societal change. Open data is the key element for this - but data is
worthless if we do not know how to interpret it. To distill information out
of data is a multi step process. The School of Data aims to teach this
process. The Data Wrangler Handbook is your companion guide through the
tools and skills needed along the way. Welcome to the wonderful world of
data (mostly harmless) and remember: **Don't Panic!**
