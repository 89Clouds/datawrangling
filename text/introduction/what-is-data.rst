Data is all around us. But what exactly is it? Data is a quantitative or
qualitative value assigned to a 
thing. Take for example the balls in the picture on the right.

What can we say about these? They are golf balls right? So one of the first
data points we have is they are used for golf. Golf is a category of sport, so this helps us to put the
ball in a taxonomy. But there is more to them right? We have the color:
“white”, the condition “used” - both qualitative data. They all have a size
and there is a certain number of them (quantitative). They probably have
some value (Since this picture is of a market) and so on. You see even
unremarkable objects have a lot of data attached. You too: you have a name
(most people have given and family names) a date of birth, weight, height,
nationality etc. All these things are data. Every day more and more data is
created. Be it because you surf on the web, someone takes a picture or does
scientific research.

From Data to Information to Knowledge
-------------------------------------

Data on it’s own is not very useful. In the example above: We
extracted some data out of the golf balls that by itself is meaningless.
To do something with it it first needs to be collected. Let’s do this in
the simple table below:

================ ==================
Color            White
Category         Sport - Golf
Condition        Used
Diameter         43mm
Price (per ball) $0.5 (AUD)
================ ==================

Each of the data values are by itself rather meaningless as well. To create
Information out of data we need to interpret the data. Let’s take the size:
A diameter of 43mm doesn't
tell us much, it only is meaningful when we compare it to other things. In sports often there are
regulations of sizes for used equipment. The minimum size of a golf ball to
be used in competitions is 42.67mm. Good, we can use that golf ball in a
competition: This is information! But it still is not knowledge.  Knowledge
is created when the information is learned, applied and understood. For
example when you are a skilled golf Player and you learned how different
attributes of a golf ball make the ball behave differently when played
