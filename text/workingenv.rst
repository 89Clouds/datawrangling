Be aware of the debugging toolbar in your browser. With the increasing 
use of dynamic page content, looking at a web pages HTML source is
becoming less helpful: you need to be able to inspect the rendered 
document object. Firefox's Firebug  used to be the tool of choice for 
this, but nowadays the toolbars in Safari and Chrome are equally useful. 
Make a habit of opening this up whenever you discover something weird or
interesting on the web.
