Spreadsheets are the most basic tools of handling data. They are simple to
use, yet with experience they become powerful. You can collect, wrangle,
analyze and visualize data with a good spreadsheet program. The only
downside to them is: they are not good at handling relational data and
datasets that become too large. The big advantage is: learning how
to use them is simple. Not surprisingly spreadsheet applications are common
and widely used. The most well known is probably Microsofts Excel (from the
Office package). However there is a large number of spreadsheet programs
availabe.

Google Docs
===========

You do not need to purchase or download programs to your computer to use
spreadsheets: `Google docs`_ offer a spreadsheet application. It is quite
commonly used when collaborating online, since data can be shared and
edited collaboratively. Google docs also offers interesting features, such
as integration of google search into the spreadsheet.
